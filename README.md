### Tech stack - Kotlin, Room, View Model, Implicit Intent.

The bookstore is designed and implemented by myself from scratch.

-Created a DreamCatcher App in Kotlin, using the **Room framework** and **SQLite** so that users could add, update and delete dreams details and dream lists.
-Used **implicit intents** to let users share dreams with other apps from the phone.
-Utilized **Coroutine, Fragments, and Dialogue** to create reusable components.
-Implemented **View Model** to retain states on configuration change.
